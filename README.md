# Junkbot

Maybe somewhat of a Junkbot recreation?

## Ideas

- Metroidvania
	- Instead of abilities like Jump, you collect blocks like Jump Block
- Gear systems
- Machine that clones Junkbot
	- You can win as long as one Junkbot remains
- Ridable giant robots / cars?
- Tetris area where you need to fix machinery that pushes the bottom four rows into trucks
- Pacman area with wrapping
- Dunkbot (basketball)
- Convert LDraw models into pixel art [with Three.js](https://threejs.org/examples/?q=ldraw#webgl_loader_ldraw) and the proper perspective and lighting and postprocessing (selective outlining would be difficult)

## Development Setup

Requirements:
- [Git][]
- [Git Large File Storage][git lfs install]
- [Node.js][]
- Lack of Lego litigation (hope they're not assholes)

Steps
- [Clone the repo.][git clone]
- Open up a command prompt / terminal in the project directory.
- Install project dependencies with `npm install`
- Run `npm start` to start a web server which will reload the page automatically when you make changes
